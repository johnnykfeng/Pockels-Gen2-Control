# Pockels-Gen2-Control

## Description
Pockels-Gen2-Control is a python-based control interface for a second-generation Pockels apparatus. The Pockels apparatus is an electro-optic device used for manipulating the polarization state of light. This project focuses on developing software to control the Pockels apparatus and integrate it into various optical systems.

## Features
- Control the voltage applied to the Pockels apparatus
- Control the optomechanics and light source involved in the measurement
- Monitor the status and performance of the Pockels apparatus
- Image processing and data analysis of the Pockels data
