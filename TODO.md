# TO DO LIST for Owen

## Routine to measure current drop 

    1. Set temperature of TEC, start with output OFF (0 volts)
    2. Start continuous measurement of current
        a. Can we control the delay time between each reading?
        b. What is the minimum delay time?
    3. Wait for current to stabilize, 2-5 seconds
    4. Turn output ON at target voltage
    5. Wait for current to stabilize, and 5 seconds after that
    6. Turn output OFF
    7. Wait for current to stabilize, and 5 seconds after that
    8. Save data into a csv file
    9. Repeat for several voltages and temperatures
